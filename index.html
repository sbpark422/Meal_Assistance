            A number of studies have been conducted to understand the accessibility issues that people with visual impairments experience.
            However, most of these are limited to navigation and object recognition tasks. In this study, we focused on providing mealtime assistance.
            We first conducted a preliminary online survey with 91 participants and an in-depth interview study with eight participants with visual impairments and two social workers.
            Based on the findings, we identified various difficulties that people with visual impairments face during mealtimes, and types of dish-related information they wish to get before and during meals.
            To understand the implications for designing the interaction of a meal assistance system for people with visual impairments, we then implemented a prototype in a virtual environment and conducted another user study with 7 participants for evaluation.
            Reflecting the findings, we suggest design recommendations for a future meal assistance system for people with visual impairments so that they can enjoy their meals independently.

          We conducted an online survey with 91 participants who have visual impairments and phone interviews with eight PVI and two social workers to understand the dining experiences of PVI.
          Through the survey and interview, we found that the majority of PVI experience difficulties identifying dishes’ locations in several situations and that most PVI rely on others for help.
          However, it has been found that PVI feel uncomfortable asking for help and have a desire to have a meal independently.
          Based on the findings, we would like to develop a meal assistance system that could support their independent eating and demonstrate how dish-related information should be delivered to PVI: an overview before a meal and guidance towards a particular dish during a meal.

              Our design probe system was implemented in the environment of Unity 2019.2.17f with a head-mounted device (i.e., <a href="https://www.vive.com/us/product/vive-pro-eye/overview/">HTC VIVE Pro Eye</a>) based on virtual reality (VR).
              To get the voice command from the users and provide the output to the users, we used <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson">IBM’s Watson</a> to receive users’ voice input through the microphone and convert it to text.
              We also used text-to-speech module to provide requested information verbally to the users. The system supports two types of assistance: (1) providing dish-related information on a table, and (2) guiding users’ hand towards a particular dish.

            <b>1. Dish-related Information.</b> The system provides the <b>overview</b> information of the dishes on a table when it detects the users’ voice command saying "overview". It informs the total number of dishes followed by the dish arrangement (e.g., "There are in total 6 dishes straightly lined up"), and how dishes are spread about (e.g., "Starting from 10 o’clock to 2 o’clock.").
            Lastly, it notifies the name of each dish one at a time from left to right.
            It also allows the users to ask the amount of food (i.e., "How much is the sandwich left?")(<b>food amount</b>).
            The system conveys information of the amount of a particular dish in four levels: Full, Half, Little, and Almost None.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2. Hand Guidance.</b> The system also helps the users to find a particular dish on a table with audio feedback. For instance, when a user asks for the location (e.g., "Where is the sandwich?"), it first verbally conveys the relative direction of the dish (e.g. "It’s at 2 o’clock"), which we refer as <b>verbal guidance</b>.
            Then it plays beeps where its frequency gets higher as a user’s hand gets closer to the target (<b>beeping guidance</b>).
            If the user finds a dish other than the target, the system informs the location of the target dish in a relative direction from the user, such as whether it is at the left or the right of the user. In addition, the system cautions the user if the temperature of the target dish is too hot.
            A number of studies have been conducted to understand the accessibility issues that people with visual impairments experience.

          We asked the participants to evaluate the overall usability of the system using system usability scale. As a result, the system was graded as B with the score of 76.1. As shown in Figure 4, participants rated higher in ease and confidence in using the system than the possibility of frequent usage and learnability. On the other hand, the complexity of the system and necessity of other people’s support was relatively low. When asked about the inclination to use the system in real life, participants had the willingness to use it in general but mentioned that some improvements should come first, especially considering the social recognition of disability.
